# enterprise-bug-solver-leaderboard
This project aims to create a leaderboard for evaluating how well different Generative AI models can solve bugs from modern enterprise codebases. While projects like SWE-bench focus on Python, we target languages and frameworks commonly used in the banking, insurance, and retail industries.
